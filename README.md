A python library to download and upload files from ANT-FS compliant devices (Garmin products).

Features
--------

 - ANT
 - ANT-FS (with command pipe, file listings, downloading, uploading, etc)
 - Three libs (ant.base basic ANT library, ant.easy blocking version using ant.base, ant.fs ANT-FS library)

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7+
- PyUSB > 1.0a2 (seems to be a bug which makes it segfaults on version before Alpha 2)
- Root access (for installation only)

Automatic install
-----------------

- Install [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools):
 
        apt-get install python-setuptools
or

        wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python

- Run the following command:

        sudo python setup.py install

This will install everything required on your active python installation.


Manual install
--------------

These should only be necessary to install manually, if you don't want to use the Automatic installation script.

- Install [PyUSB](https://github.com/walac/pyusb).

        pip install pyusb

    *(Or alternatively from [sources available on GitHub](https://github.com/walac/pyusb))*

- Install [udev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev) rules (Only required to avoid running the program as root).

        sudo python setup.py udev_rules
